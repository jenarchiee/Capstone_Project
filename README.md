# Forecasting Defendant Failure to Appear and Case Disposition Time

This is my capstone project. My teammates and I forecasted the Defendant Failure to Appear rate and Time to Dispostion for a local Washington state county (data, codes, and report are unable to be published due to privacy). 

## Problem

Before a case is presented in front of a court, a hearing would be scheduled to justify the legitimation of the case and whether the defendant is held guilty. There is an ongoing problem of defendants failing to appear the hearing, leading to different consequences (e.g. delay time to disposition). 

## Solution and Results 

* Developed logistic regression model as a benchmark for decision tree, SVN, KNN, and neural network by utilizing Python to predict defendants' hearing appearance pattern and time to disposition with the accuracy rate of 68%.

* Processed local Washington state county data, implemented and visualized Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and conducted feature engineering from six datasets by utilizing Python to improve the performance of models by 37.5%.

* Presented results, wrote reports to interpret and evaluate different models, as well as proposed recommendations to the local criminal justice system by minimizing defendant failure-to-appear rate and time to disposition.
